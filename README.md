# Lisp

A collection of programming examples in Lisp. Nothing comprehensive here, only
snippets.





## Table of contents

### [01. "Hello, world"](01-hello-world/)

A clich√© introduction to Lisp that has more comments than actual Lisp.





## Purpose of this repository

As part of my efforts to learn Lisp (using [Practical Common
Lisp](http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/) as my initial guide), I will use this
repository as a place to keep track of anything and everything that I learn.

Files are named and organised in chronological order but do not expect any
consistency or patterns with the contents or topics covered.
